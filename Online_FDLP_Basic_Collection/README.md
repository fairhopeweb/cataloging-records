# Online FDLP Basic Collection

The FDLP Basic Collection is a list of resources that every library in the program is required to have accessible for immediate use of the public.  There are currently 23 resources in the Basic Collection and all are available in online format.  The record sets contain the bibliographic records for the online versions of the Basic Collection resources in UTF-8, MARC-8, and MARCXML formats.  More information about the Basic Collection is available on the [FDLP website](https://www.fdlp.gov/requirements-guidance-2/collections-and-databases/basic-collection).

Please send us your feedback and questions about our repository and records by submitting an inquiry in the `Cataloging/Metadata (Policy and Records)` category via [askGPO](https://ask.gpo.gov/s/).
