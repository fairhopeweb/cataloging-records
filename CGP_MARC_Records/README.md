# CGP MARC Record Sets

This collection contains six monthly sets of new and updated catalog records, which are available in UTF-8, MARC-8, and MARCXML formats, and text files with the OCLC and CGP system numbers of the records deleted from the CGP. The naming conventions of the files are as follows: “**cataloging_records-YYYYMM_####_format.mrc**”.  The abbreviation YYYYMM stands for the year and month, and #### represents the number of bibliographic records in the record set. Format indicates if the character set is in UTF-8, MARC-8, or MARCXML format.
  
Each of the files includes the following categories of bibliographic records:

* Records created/updated by the LTS staff with valid OCLC numbers

* Records created/updated as part of the Historic Shelflist project

* Newly created/updated brief bibliographic records
