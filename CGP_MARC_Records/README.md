# CGP MARC Record Sets

Six monthly sets of new and updated catalog records are available in UTF-8, MARC-8, and MARCXML formats. The naming conventions of the files are as follows: “**cataloging_records-YYYYMM_####_format.mrc**”.  The abbreviation YYYYMM stands for the year and month, and #### represents the number of bibliographic records in the record set. Format indicates if the character set is in UTF-8, MARC-8, or MARCXML format.
  
Each of the files includes the following categories of bibliographic records:

* Records created/updated by the LTS staff with valid OCLC numbers

* Records created/updated as part of the Historic Shelflist project

* Newly created/updated brief bibliographic records

* Text file containing identification numbers of records deleted from the current record set
