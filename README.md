# Cataloging-records

The **CGP on GitHub** is a location where users may freely download record sets extracted from the [Catalog of U.S. Government Publications](https://catalog.gpo.gov) (CGP). The CGP is the U.S. Government Publishing Office's (GPO) finding tool for electronic and print publications from the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of the U.S. government. These publications make up the National Bibliography of U.S. Government Publications. CGP records contain descriptive information for historical and current publications and provides direct links to those that are available online. Records produced by GPO staff meet national standards such as Resource Description & Access (RDA) and Anglo-American Cataloging Rules (AACR2), and include GPO Historic Shelflist project brief bibliographic records and other retrospective records.  

MARC record files are offered in **UTF-8**, **MARC-8**, and **MARCXML** formats.  

To download the files, use the “Code” button in the right-hand section of this page and select “Download ZIP.” The ZIP file contains all of the files in the repository.
