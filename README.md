# Cataloging-records

The **CGP on GitHub** is a repository of cataloging/metadata resources extracted from the bibliographic records of the  [Catalog of U.S. Government Publications](https://catalog.gpo.gov) (CGP). The CGP is the U.S. Government Publishing Office's (GPO) finding tool for publications of the executive, judicial, and legislative branches, and other entities of the U.S. Federal Government. The CGP records comprise the National Bibliography of U.S. Government Publications and contain descriptive and subject information to enable the discovery of these resources. Many CGP records provide PURL (persistent uniform resource locator) links to the online versions of publications. For more information, please visit the CGP [help pages](https://catalog.gpo.gov/cgphelp/en/help.html).

The collections in the repository have been created based on various criteria, such as issuing agencies, publication formats, and topical and chronological coverage. All collections contain one or more of these resources:

- MARC record files
  - MARCXML
  - UTF-8
- CSV files of multiple major metadata elements of the records
- PDFs of multiple major metadata elements of the records and the titles linked to the PURLs and the CGP record numbers link to the records
- Record display pages of several major metadata elements and the titles linked to the PURLs and the CGP numbers linked to the records

MARC record files are offered in **UTF-8** and **MARCXML** formats.  

To download the files, use the “Code” button in the right-hand section of this page and select “Download ZIP.” The ZIP file contains all of the files in the repository.
