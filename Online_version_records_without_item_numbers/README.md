# Online version records without Item Numbers

When GPO catalogs online resources and does not include item numbers, these records are not distributed to Federal depository libraries through the item selection system. Therefore Federal depository libraries have not received these records from us. We have not provided item numbers in various situations:

- The publication was distributed before 1940, and no item number was assigned at the time of distribution.
- The document was published after October 1942, and no item number was found in the Monthly Catalog of U.S. Government Publications.
- The document was published before October 1942, when GPO started to print item numbers in the Monthly Catalog of U.S. Government Publications.
- At the time of cataloging, the issuing agency was no longer active.

Please send us your feedback and questions about our repository and records by submitting an inquiry in the `Cataloging/Metadata (Policy and Records)` category via [askGPO](https://ask.gpo.gov/s/).

This list contains 4,959 records, and is current as of January 24, 2023.
