# Legal Publications Collection

The Legal Publications Collection is divided into two files, one for titles available in tangible format and another for titles available in online format. The tangible record set was created from the [Print Distribution Titles](https://www.fdlp.gov/file-repository-item/print-distribution-titles-pdt-list-12012023) (PDT) list that circulated during the shift to a digital FDLP. This set includes nine titles: all seven of the unlimited titles and two titles set for distribution of fifty copies. These titles, along with the eighty-three titles that comprise the online record set, were chosen because they are selected for by at least half of all law libraries in the FDLP as of 2023.
